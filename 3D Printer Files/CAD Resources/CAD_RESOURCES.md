# CAD Resources

The "CAD Resources Folder" contains versions of all the 3D printer files in formats better suited to editing. **These files are only necessary if you want to edit or change the original designs.** If you just want to print the components, you can ignore everything in the CAD resources folder.

## .f3d

All 3D printed parts for the VPD were designed in Fusion360, whose native file format is .f3d. If you have access to Fusion360, we recommend using the .f3d files. These files retain timeline information making small edits extremly easy.

## .step

STEP files are a general CAD file format that work across every major CAD program. While editable, the lack of a timeline history makes tweaking small details difficult.
