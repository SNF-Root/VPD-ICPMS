# Laser Cutter Files

Within the "Laser Cutter Files" folder are two subfolders:

* DXFs
* SVGs

Each of these subfolders has 8 files for each of the 8 acrylic side panels. The only difference between the two subfolders is the file format; they both contain the same designs. Use whichever file format is best for your laser cutter control program.
